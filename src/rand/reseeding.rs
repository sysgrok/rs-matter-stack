//! A wrapper around another PRNG that reseeds it after it
//! generates a certain number of random bytes.
//!
//! Derived from the `ReseedingRng` of the `rand` project (retired there in `rand` 0.10),
//! re-implemented on top of the plain `rand_core` 0.10 traits rather than its block API
//! so that it can wrap any `SeedableRng` PRNG.

use rand_core::{SeedableRng, TryCryptoRng, TryRng};

/// A wrapper around any PRNG that implements [`SeedableRng`] and [`TryRng`],
/// that adds the ability to reseed it.
///
/// `ReseedingRng` reseeds the underlying PRNG in the following cases:
///
/// - On a manual call to [`reseed()`].
/// - After `clone()`, the clone will be reseeded on first use.
/// - After a specified number of bytes has been generated (the threshold).
///
/// When the threshold is reached and the reseeding operation fails, a warning is logged
/// and the PRNG keeps generating from its current state; the reseeding is retried
/// after the next threshold worth of bytes.
///
/// # Error handling
///
/// Although unlikely, reseeding the wrapped PRNG can fail. `ReseedingRng` will never panic
/// along this code path; instead, it logs the error and continues with the not-reseeded PRNG.
/// If you need to reseed the PRNG and be sure it happened, call [`reseed()`] directly.
///
/// [`reseed()`]: ReseedingRng::reseed
